### Data is Beautiful

Kimo Quaintance, lives in Eastleigh and he interviewed some Somali people living in Eastleigh, some of them very recently arriving, some of them settled in Eastleigh for hundreds of years. And he asked them for permission to harvest their Facebook network data-- something you can do with a tool Netvizz-- and then visualize them using another tool called Gephi.

This is how it looks like when put together the social network of these guys.
So each round is what's, in social network parlance, referred to as a node, and it's just a person.
Each little ray is a link between this person and their contacts on Facebook. So this is someone who is identified as a contact.

And the size of the bubbles is proportional to the importance of the person in the social network. It's not just a nice graph, you can see, for example, a person here on the top right to be quite an important person. And here, you might ask immediately, well, what does important mean? It could be the degree of the node, which in plain English would be the number of connections they have. Or it could be that someone doesn't have all that many friends, but he could be important because he's friends with someone who are important.


So there are people who met because they're from the same hometown. There are people who took a class together. There are people who went to boarding school together. There are people who are working together. And we can also visualize that with the color, and then order the data; also kind of put the nodes somewhere in the network such that these things kind of are nicely separated. So that's one example of very beautiful data.

### Data Is Insightful

In this is very, very nice work by Michael Greenstone and his co-authors looking at one particular natural experiment in China, about a policy that was given by the government was very different on the north and the south of the black line. On the north of the black line, heating was subsidized and heating via coal-- coal heating-- was subsidized. And on the south, it wasn't. So now we can see that, clearly, something seemed to be going on on the north versus the south.

In this two-dimensional plane of data, where I'm looking at the degree north of the Huai
River boundary. So negative means it's in the south, and then positive is in the north.
And we are going closer and closer and closer to the river. What you can see is that that seems to be the case, where the line that start from the south goes up as you get closer and closer to the boundary, which does make sense because pollution travels through the air. So they probably would get some of the pollution from the north. And then there is a big jump at the north. And that's kind of a little bit more constant, maybe, to the right. So this jump-- you have a nice little text box here that really nicely illustrates what they find. It's a jump of 4.1 microgram per cubic meter and is statistically significant.

But if we look to life expectancy. So life expectancy is higher in the south of the river compared to the north of the river. Another thing you see that is nice in this graph is, unlike pollution, the mortality-- other than the fact that there is this jump, the mortality doesn't seem to be widely different from both sides. The thing is, heat is actually a nice thing to have. So even though pollution probably killed some people, as we can see, it might be the case that heat also saved some people's life.
So from this graph, you might not necessarily conclude that, oh, we better stop the subsidies for heat.
The only thing you might be willing to conclude is that particulate matters are not good for you. So that's a graph that I think that has a little story -- very nicely encapsulates the type of insight we can get from data.

### Data is Powerful

<b>Example: Changing regulation in India</b>
We worked with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, again this is with Michael Greenstone, and also with Rohini Pande and Nick Ryan. The city had a problem. The auditing sytem was private. So a firm that is in a polluting sector is required to hire an auditor. And what is an auditor? It's a private firm that has to have some minimum competences in terms of engineers and scientists, They had a clear conflict of interest and perverse incentives. The solution was firms would pay into a central pool, auditors from the central pool are randomly assigned to firms.

In general a histogram depicts the number (or fraction) of observations that falls within certain ranges of a particular outcome measurement

### Data Can Be Deceitful

So there is this graph that shows very strong correlation between enrollment in secondary school and log GDP per capita, that shows that where people are more educated in countries where people are more educated they're also richer.  This correlation people have used to motivate policy-- for example, you know, build schools, and build support for education, spending on education, etc. And in particular, this correlation is much stronger than the similar correlation you could find at the individual level. So in general, one more year of education increases your earnings by about 7 to 8% in most countries, but it suggest a much, much steeper correlation between the two. So that makes you to think well, maybe the whole is better. 

<img src="gdpedu.png" width="600px;">

But other possible interpretation, there are hidden variables that explain both of these things. Maybe the government supports education and something else does not that makes them richer. Maybe governments that are able to have good schools are also able to control malaria and are able to have a good functioning credit market and all sorts of stuff like that.

### Correlation versus Causation
Correlation is not causality. By hunting for correlations in the data, one can often find entirely spurious patterns. Controlling for variables other than treatment and outcome could better isolate the relationship that we are interested in.
